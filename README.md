# Black-Scholes-model-and-IV-cpp

This is code to calculate an option chain and implied volatility for each contract in cpp. I think it is a good bit of code but of course because I don't have access to an exchange market price I cannot accurately represent IV. I used a random number generator to simulate market noise for each contract.
